## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I have always been the go-to person for tackling math and physics challenges. Solving problems fills me with genuine joy, and I vividly recall spending days grappling with complex questions during my high school and university years. For me, the greatest reward is the knowledge gainedâ€”no matter how smallâ€”at the end of each day. This insatiable curiosity has driven me to explore advanced techniques in my field, leading to 14 published papers and 2 more currently under review. I take great pride in my contributions to research and my continuous pursuit of learning. My projects have conducted using Computer Softwares like; LabVIEW, MATLAB, Lumerical, Zemax, Python, Fortran, Maple, R-soft, COMSOL Multiphysics
